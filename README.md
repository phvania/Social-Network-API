## Description:
build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. You’ll use Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.
create your own data using Insomnia after you’ve created your API.
Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

## Landuages Used:
Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
mongoose ODM

## Installation:
